# Backbone Assessment

This assessment depends on `phantomjs` to run integration specs. Here's
how to install:

```sh
$ sudo port selfupdate && sudo port install phantomjs
```

Lets take **1 hour**. There are two sets of specs to run, Jasmine specs
and Capybara (integration) specs.

First run the Jasmine specs by running `rake jasmine` and browse to
`localhost:8888`.

Running the integration specs requires the test database to be migrated.
Run `rake db:test:load` to get the database setup.

Then to run the integration specs, run `rspec spec/features/integration_spec.rb`.

Jasmine doesn't behave well with JST so the templates are written inline
for you.  _.template("<%= obj.method() %>"), will create a template
function similar to how JST["posts/form"] does. Try not to let this trip
you up.

Keep in mind that the order of routes matter.

cats/:id
cats/new //=> this route will never fire, as it will match the cats/:id first.

all of the specs are under `spec/javascripts`

Take a look at routes.rb and you'll notice that posts are available from
`/api/posts`
